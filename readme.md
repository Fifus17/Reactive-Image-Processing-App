# Reactive Image Processing App

Welcome to the Reactive Image Processing App, a full-stack project that combines JavaFX and Java for the frontend and Kotlin Spring Boot with WebFlux for the highly responsive and reactive backend. We leverage Netty as a powerful server to ensure optimal performance and efficiency, and MongoDB serves as the backend's data storage.
